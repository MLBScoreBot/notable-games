## Game-Ending Scoring Plays ##

This document is an attempt at listing some of the more unusual ways in which a game can end, although examples of more common plays will also be included for completeness.

### Obstruction calls ###

There are two known game-ending obstruction calls in MLB history, so this is a comprehensive list. The source for both games is Retrosheet via [this ESPN article](http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10647034/mlb-2013-world-series-obstruction-call).

#### August 6th, 2004 (Seattle Mariners at Tampa Bay Devil Rays) ####

Runner's view of the catch on a relatively routine tag-up play was obstructed, so he was awarded home in the bottom of the 10th.
