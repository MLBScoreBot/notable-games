This document is an attempt at listing examples of a variety of scoring plays, ranging from garden-variety RBI singles to runners passing each other on the bases.

### Runners Passing Each Other ###

** July 3rd, 2006 (Pittsburgh Pirates at New York Mets) ** - The batter thought that the ball had been caught and passed a runner (who had safely reached second base) while attempting to return to the dugout. Nevertheless, he was credited with an RBI single because another runner had scored on the play.
