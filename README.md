## Notable MLB Games ##

This project aims to build a reasonably comprehensive list of games that are unusual or otherwise notable.

The immediate goal of such an undertaking is to build a test suite for [@MLBScoreBot](https://twitter.com/MLBScoreBot), but these lists will hopefully be interesting in their own right.

### Categories ###

* [Game-ending scoring plays](https://github.com/MLBScoreBot/notable-games/blob/master/game-ending-scoring-plays.md)
* [Other scoring plays](https://github.com/MLBScoreBot/notable-games/blob/master/scoring-plays.md)

### References ###

The best reference for these games seems to be Retrosheet's [Lists of Noteworthy Events](http://www.retrosheet.org/lists.htm) and [Strange and Unusual Plays](http://www.retrosheet.org/strange.htm) page.

For individual games, [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org/), [Baseball-Reference.com](http://www.baseball-reference.com/), and [MLB.com](http://mlb.mlb.com/home) (plus the Gameday API) are linked.

### Contributing ###

Pull requests are more than welcome. Please include references to the game on at least two different sites (preferably selected from the above sources), and include a link to the game on MLB.com and the Gameday API (including the ID) if at all possible.
